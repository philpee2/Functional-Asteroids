Functional Asteroids
=========

## Overview

A rebuilt version of my [Asteroids](https://github.com/philpee2/Asteroids) project, but this time
with code that is functional instead of object oriented.

Asteroids is built using HTML canvas, JavaScript, Redux, Babel, Flow, and Webpack.
The opening mode-chooser UI is built with React.

## Running locally

* Clone the repo
* `npm install`
* `webpack`
* `open index.html`
