Functional Asteroids
=========

## Overview

A rebuilt version of my [Asteroids](https://github.com/philpee2/Asteroids) project, but this time
with code that is functional instead of object oriented.

Asteroids is built using the following tools:
* HTML canvas to draw the game
* [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) to manage the game state
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) to build the opening UI for choosing a mode
* [Babel](https://github.com/babel/babel) to transpile JS and JSX
* [Flow](https://github.com/facebook/flow) to add type checking
* [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack) for module bundling
* [Aphrodite](https://github.com/Khan/aphrodite) for styling in JS
* [Keymaster](https://github.com/madrobby/keymaster) for key press handling
* [Lodash](https://github.com/lodash/lodash) for utility functions
* [Enumify](https://github.com/rauschma/enumify) to provide enums
* [ESLint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) to provide linting

## Running locally

* Clone the repo
* `npm install`
* `webpack`
* `open index.html`
